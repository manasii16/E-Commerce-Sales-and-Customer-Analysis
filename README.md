SQL E-commerce Sales and Customer Analysis

## Objective:
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a database for an e-commerce platform using SQL. The project covers customer and sales data management, and it includes analysis of top-selling products, monthly sales trends, and customer purchase behavior.

## Database Schema:
- **Customers Table**: Contains customer details (name, email, phone)
- **Products Table**: Contains product information (name, category, price)
- **Orders Table**: Contains order data (order_date, total_amount)
- **OrderDetails Table**: Contains item details for each order (quantity, unit_price)

## SQL Queries:
- **Top-selling Products**: Identifies the most popular products based on sales quantity.
- **Monthly Sales Report**: Displays total sales per month.
- **Customer Purchase Summary**: Summarizes customer spending and order count.

## Steps to Run the Project:
1. Execute the `create_tables.sql` script to create the necessary tables.
2. Execute the `insert_data.sql` script to populate the tables with sample data.
3. Use the SQL queries in `analysis_queries.sql` to perform various analyses.

## Tools Used:
- SQL (MySQL)
- GitHub for version control
